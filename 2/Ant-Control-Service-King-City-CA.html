<p>Socio-psychological factors consisting of reasonable and moral factors to consider were discovered to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness incident and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study performed by Parsa et al. (2014) also revealed that a lack of certified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM implementation in industrialized nations.</p>
