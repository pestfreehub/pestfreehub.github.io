These might or may not consist of products noted on the Organic Products Review Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and particularly insecticides used in natural farming and natural gardening are generally much safer than synthetic pesticides, they are not constantly more environmentally friendly or safe than synthetic pesticides and can cause damage.</p>
