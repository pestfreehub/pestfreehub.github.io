D's has been my only option for over 15 years for pest and weed control as well as fertilizer treatment. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture resulting from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>The decision of the correct cause of pest issue (understanding pest biology) and ecology is important in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the detriment of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to the majority of insects (broad-spectrum) will more negatively impact natural enemies than materials that are narrow-spectrum or selective for specific insect types or life stages.</p>
<p>A typical pitfall most businesses run into is describing their business name too actually by using overused pest control terms like control, insecticide, management, and pesticide. The pest management market is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the general public and approximately 150,000 pest control service personnel.
