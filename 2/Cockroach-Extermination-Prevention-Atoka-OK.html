For pest control, temperature should be 68 ° F or lower, and relative humidity should be kept listed below an optimum of 70%; however, keeping climate conditions suggested for the conservation of books and paper will help to control insect populations. For example, feeding activities of certain caterpillars on the leaves of tomatoes and potatoes induce a systemic production of protease inhibitors revealed throughout the plant that disrupt the food digestion process and feeding habits of insects (36 ).</p>
