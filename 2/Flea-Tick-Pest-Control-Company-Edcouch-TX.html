<h3>Benefits of Using a Qualified Pest Control Service Edcouch TX</h3>
<p>The clinical basis of "Integrated Pest Control" progressed over a period of about ten years, primarily among scientists at the University of California, Berkeley and Riverside schools. Crops are typically monocultures, including a single crop species, which produces a homogenous environment often lacking essential requirements of natural enemies, thus preferring pest types.</p>
<p>Saved product pests are more than likely to be in a food active ingredient on delivery to a processing factory or a processed food when kept for a long period of time. Applying pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a routine basis, regardless of requirement, is not IPM. The dependence on pesticides as a sole approach of control has led to the development of insect resistance and negative effects on human health, natural opponents, and the environment.</p>
