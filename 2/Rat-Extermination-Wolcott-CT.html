The term pest" refers to more than one cause of issues including illness, undesirable insects, termites, mollusks, nematodes and weeds. A number of treatment techniques have actually been utilized, consisting of chemical techniques, such as pesticide applications and hazardous gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating up the products, the use of micro-waves, gamma radiation, customized atmospheres, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
