<p>They thought that some qualities of area-wide management are incompatible with lots of standard IRM techniques, however suggested that use of biologically based control methods, such as behavior-disrupting chemicals, might add to both area-wide pest management and IRM. After implementing any pest management tactic, examine the indicator plants to assess if arthropod pests have actually been eliminated and evaluate the efficiency and durability of control.</p>

<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic methods to control family insect pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simple definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about reducing pesticide use.

To minimize prospective damage to advantageous insects, restrict your spraying to small areas where you can see pests prowling, and leave a couple of unsprayed "havens" for any good bugs you can't see.</p>
