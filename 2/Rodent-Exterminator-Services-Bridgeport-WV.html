IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will ensure beneficial economic condition, ecological and social consequences 13 and applies to most farming, public health and feature pest management scenarios.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and discourage pest persistence include intercropping (multiple crops in the exact same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with choose application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and died off for the season.</p>
<p>The human reaction depends upon the importance of the damage done, and will vary from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely get rid of the pest. Current experiences with insect pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for key examples in the discussion.
