<p>Biological pest control procedures take advantage of the hierarchy within nature. IPM programmes initial task is to develop appropriate pest levels, called action thresholds, and apply controls where the limits are crossed. Understanding of these thresholds and characteristics of pests and natural enemies assists to avoid unneeded (chemical) interventions. Some termite control technicians even fix structural damage caused by termites.</p>
