<p>The behavior of the pest can be made use of for its tracking and control through baits, traps, and mating disturbance methods (Heinz et al. 1992, Shorey and Gerber 1996, Foster and Harris 1997, Vladés et al. 2005, El-Sayed et al. 2009, Morrison et al. 2016 ). When dispersed in the field or positioned in traps, baits consisting of poisonous material will bring in and kill the pests.</p>

Recently, the European Union has actually adopted IPM as a policy for management of insect pests. If outsourced, the food business should realize it has an equivalent function to play in pest control" with the pest management professional, states Dr. Siddiqi.</p>
