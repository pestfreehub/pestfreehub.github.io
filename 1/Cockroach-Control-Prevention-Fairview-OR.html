Focusing primarily on long-term pest avoidance, a successful IPM program utilizes a combination of control techniques consisting of biological control, habitat adjustment, modifications to cultural practices and use of resistant plant ranges.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that encourage natural enemies and discourage pest determination include intercropping (several crops in the very same field) to make it harder for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which attract pests far from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to coincide with times where pests have actually emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
