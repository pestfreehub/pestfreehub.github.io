The brand-new ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is applied to silence specific genes in the target bug is thought about as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Specific biostimulants based upon minerals, microorganisms, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart caused systemic resistance to pests, illness, and abiotic stress factors, but are used as modifications with no claims for pest or disease control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These brand-new items or innovations can fall into several abovementioned classifications of pest management.</p>
