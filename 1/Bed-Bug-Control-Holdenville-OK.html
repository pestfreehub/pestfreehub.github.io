<p>The new ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is applied to silence particular genes in the target insect is thought about as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Certain biostimulants based upon minerals, microorganisms, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart caused systemic resistance to pests, illness, and abiotic stressors, but are applied as amendments without any claims for pest or disease control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ). These new products or technologies can fall under one or more abovementioned categories of pest management.</p>
<p>There are many farming practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests.

<p>Secondly, the best pest control brand names won't leave a single bed bug behind.
