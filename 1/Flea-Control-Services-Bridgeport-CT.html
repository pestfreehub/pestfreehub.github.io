Pests seek out locations with a plentiful food source, along with a safe environment in which they can breed. Other reasonably low-risk pesticides are readily available for some pests. Inoculative biological control indicates launching natural opponents periodically or seasonally to restore a balance that has not been maintained naturally or has actually been disrupted by other control approaches.</p>
<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and prevent pest persistence consist of intercropping (several crops in the same field) to make it more difficult for pests to find a host plant, planting trap crops which bring in pests away from harvest crops and which can later be treated with select application of pesticides, and postponing planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and died off for the season.</p>
