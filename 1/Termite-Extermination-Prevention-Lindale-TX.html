<p>The course will focus on the eco-friendly and management concepts of pest control and you will learn to assess the consequences of pesticide usage and application on the biological target. The United States EPA Biopesticides page includes more useful details. Adoption of IPM can be seen under a continuum, starting with systems largely restricted to utilizing a single tactical technique such as using financial thresholds for better timing of pesticide applications.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest issues, classical biological control approach is generally utilized where natural opponents from the native area of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control method that has actually been efficiently utilized versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production uses much of the very same ideas as IPM but limits using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to decrease the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
