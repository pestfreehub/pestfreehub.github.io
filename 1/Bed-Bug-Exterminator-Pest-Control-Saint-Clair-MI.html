Ideally, these thresholds change for modifications in market value, phase of crop development, expense of pesticides, etc., however in truth most are based upon repaired invasion or damage levels.</p>
<p>The decision of the right cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is vital in controling the environment to the crop's advantage and to the hinderance of the pest.

<p>Pests managed: Usage horticultural oils to fight aphids, mites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies. Under EPM, chemicals need to be used only as a last option, after mechanical, cultural, and biological approaches have been attempted and shown inefficient.
