<p>Examples of cultural practices that motivate natural enemies and discourage pest perseverance include intercropping (numerous crops in the very same field) to make it more difficult for pests to discover a host plant, planting trap crops which draw in pests far from harvest crops and which can later on be treated with select application of pesticides, and delaying planting times to accompany times where pests have emerged and passed away off for the season.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control household pest pests. Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being practically exclusively about decreasing pesticide use. If all other integrated pest management methods are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic limit, then use of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid financial loss is warranted.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural food production applies much of the exact same ideas as IPM however restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to artificial chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to decrease the need for other, less environmentally favorable, herbicides.</p>
