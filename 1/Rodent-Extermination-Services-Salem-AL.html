IPM is a method to guarantee financial viability at both customer and producer level (seller is constantly anticipated to earn a profit), ecological safety through a balanced use of all available pest control options, and social acceptability considering that IPM-based food is safe and budget-friendly.</p>
<p>Part of this success came from field schools which permitted local farmers to harness their native understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the selection and use of pest control actions that will ensure favourable financial condition, social and eco-friendly effects 13 and applies to a lot of agricultural, public health and feature pest management situations.</p>

Sprays, are best used against flying pests and biting pests, such as fleas Many insects will pass away within minutes of entering contact with an insecticide spray, however some stubborn bugs might make you spray the location multiple times before giving up.</p>
<p>Utilizing information about pests' biology and practices, together with an arsenal of pest management techniques, pest control workers locate, determine, and get rid of pests. However because these "sex" traps attract mainly male insects, they aren't extremely efficient controls. This includes mechanical, physical, cultural, biological and chemical control of pest. A regular monitoring program is the basis of IPM choice making, despite the control techniques used.</p>
