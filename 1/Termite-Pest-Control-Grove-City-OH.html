<p>The various factors associated with the value chain of the insect pest control market include basic material suppliers, R&D institutes, insect pest control services producing companies such as Bayer (Germany), Syngenta (Switzerland), BASF (Germany), FMC Corporation (US), and federal government bodies & regulatory associations such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA).</p>

<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a process that is used to control pest populations while reducing the influence on individuals and the surrounding environment. Though there is a controversy of using chemicals due to ecological pollution it is a reality that this is the only approach which is widely accepted and provided reliable control of pest.</p>

Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to lower the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
