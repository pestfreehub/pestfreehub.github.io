<p>The lots of differing threats from pests make it recommended for cultural heritage companies to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their buildings and collections. In these nations, routine use of pesticides is limited to high value (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly fixated cotton, soybean, sugarcane, and rice.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production uses much of the exact same concepts as IPM but limits making use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of artificial chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to reduce the requirement for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
