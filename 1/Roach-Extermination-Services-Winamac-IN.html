The goal is to provide a general understanding of the principles of IPM, together with the principles for implementation in all crops. When a crop is under tension it can be less efficient in dealing with the tension caused by insects that draw out plant sap (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers) and this tension might a little decrease the economic threshold.</p>
<p>The human reaction depends on the value of the damage done, and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely get rid of the pest. Current experiences with bug pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for crucial examples in the conversation. The term Integrated Pest Management (IPM) describes pest control and prevention programs that rely on a number of synchronised techniques to get the wanted outcome.</p>
