<p>Problems with pesticide-intensive pest control programs (see above) are the driving force behind IPM adoption or at least consideration for its adoption at the regional or national level in many countries, and in many it has actually ended up being main governmental policy.

Management decisions must be based on monitoring and population levels of insect pests, in addition to reputable thresholds.
