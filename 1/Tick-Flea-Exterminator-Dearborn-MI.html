Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western ruined plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been advised as an IPM method by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the concept did not take off due to the fact that growers were not all set for such an intercropping plan. If your center currently makes use of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be amazed to hear that the pest control industry has and will continue to move toward least-impact product or services.</p>
