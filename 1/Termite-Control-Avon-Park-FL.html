<p>Socio-psychological elements consisting of logical and ethical considerations were discovered to the drivers in IPM application in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of veggie growers in Sri Lanka showed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness incident and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
