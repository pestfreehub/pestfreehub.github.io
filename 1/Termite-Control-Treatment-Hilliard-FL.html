<p>Savannah's historical structures and thoughtful homes draw in more than travelers. The brand-new ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) innovation where double-stranded RNA is applied to silence specific genes in the target pest is considered as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Certain biostimulants based upon minerals, microbes, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart induced systemic resistance to pests, diseases, and abiotic stressors, but are applied as changes without any claims for pest or illness control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ).
