<p>As a very first line of pest control, IPM programs work to manage the crop, yard, or indoor area to avoid pests from becoming a risk. Since IPM is a complicated pest control process, not simply a series of practices, it is difficult to use one IPM definition for all foods and all locations of the country. By making use of structural and biological strategies we're much better able to control a wide range of pest related issues.</p>
<p>Stay alert and contact your pest control expert for a follow-up treatment if you ever see pests returning after treatment. Modern crop varieties typically unintentionally create conditions which favor pest species (e.g., pest types which have actually bored deeper into bigger fruit making them inaccessible to natural opponents). Anticipate SARS-CoV-2 to act like an invasive species introduced to a new location when resources are plentiful (that is, people without immunity) and there are no biological controls to keep the population in check or registered items to utilize in management (such as federally approved medications).</p>
