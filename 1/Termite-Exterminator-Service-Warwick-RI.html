<p>The four major problems come across with conventional pesticides are poisonous residues, pest resistance, secondary pests, and pest revival (Lewis, 1997 ). Using natural pesticides and organophosphates that are more eco-friendly are encouraged and artificial pesticides should just be used as a last resort or only used as needed and typically just at particular times in a pests life cycle.</p>
<p>They primarily utilize natural methods and pesticides that are evaluated and accredited and are secure for use and do not possess any harmful effects on the environment. This and other pathogens are effective biological pesticides for very specific pests.

Illness, weeds, and insects can trigger expensive and irreparable damage to animals and crops. The insect pest control market is a fragmented one with a a great deal of domestic makers, formulators, service, providers, and providers.</p>
