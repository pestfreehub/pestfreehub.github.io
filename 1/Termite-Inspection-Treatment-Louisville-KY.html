<p>Constant monitoring and tracking of insect pests population is important for evaluation of damage and for determining the requirements for actions to be taken. Chemical pest control is using pesticides to ruin damaging insects ororganisms. Current issue for pollinator health has actually also resulted in limitations on making use of certain pesticides. To prevent plant damage, do not spray any plants struggling with moisture stress.</p>
<p>Natural opponents such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very effective in causing substantial reductions in pest populations in certain situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially readily available natural enemies or saving natural opponent populations by offering havens or avoiding practices that harm them are some of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>A few of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, efficient against sucking pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, effective versus red cotton bug, cutworms, insects; botanical mixtures, mixes of extracts from various plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, chilly, gliricidia, marigold, etc</p>
