<p>Throughout numerous outreach conferences and field trips organized solely for the public in Southern California during the previous couple of years, it was evident that a majority was not knowledgeable about farming systems, had misunderstanding about sustainable agriculture, and believed that natural food is pesticide-free (Dara personal observations and unpublished study information).</p>
<p>Kaolin particle movies utilized in organic farming may control some pests, but can negatively impact natural enemies and cause other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices may motivate natural enemy populations, however a greater number of natural opponents does not always lead to pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling use nonrenewable fuel sources and indirectly have an unfavorable influence on the environment.</p>
