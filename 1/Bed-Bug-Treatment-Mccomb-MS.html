<p>Part of this success originated from field schools which enabled regional farmers to harness their native knowledge of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the choice and use of pest control actions that will ensure beneficial economic condition, social and environmental effects 13 and is applicable to many farming, public health and feature pest management circumstances.</p>
<p>For instance, diesel-powered tractors are run for vacuuming western stained bug in strawberry 2-3 times or more every week while a pesticide application generally needs the use of tractor as soon as every 7-14 d. To control particular pests, multiple applications of natural pesticides might be needed with associated dangers and expenses, while similar pest populations could be controlled by fewer chemical pesticide applications.</p>
<p>The lots of differing dangers from pests make it suggested for cultural heritage companies to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and buildings.
