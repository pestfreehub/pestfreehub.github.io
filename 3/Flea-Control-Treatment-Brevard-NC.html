<p>Natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very efficient in causing substantial decreases in pest populations in particular circumstances (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially offered natural opponents or conserving natural enemy populations by providing sanctuaries or avoiding practices that damage them are a few of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>Without controls on population growth, organisms can quickly accomplish levels at which damage is triggered thus becoming pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare).
