<p>Think about alternative methods (besides pesticides) to make your house and garden unappealing to pests. With IPM, you do something about it to keep pests from ending up being an issue, such as by growing a healthy crop that can withstand pest attacks, using disease-resistant plants, or caulking cracks to keep insects or rodents from entering a structure. Current missions for effective, safe, and enduring pest management programs have been targeted mainly towards development of brand-new and much better items with which to change traditional hazardous pesticides.</p>
<p>The term "integrated" was thus associated with "suitable." Chemical controls were to be applied only after regular monitoring suggested that a pest population had reached a level (the financial threshold) that required treatment to avoid the population from reaching a level (the economic injury level) at which economic losses would exceed the expense of the control steps.</p>
