<p>4 ). With its success in many parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a cost-effective and environmentally benign pest control method preferably suited for both small and big farmers all over the world. Once termites have actually entered a building, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, cloth, carpets and more. In some ways, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making procedure in which observations (from inspection and monitoring) are utilized to make pest control choices based upon pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>The very best way to control pests is to make your home unappealing to them. But home pests can likewise be a danger to your household. When searching for a location to infest, pests prefer to hide in a location that offers food and a safe breeding ground. Biological control is a lot easier to execute in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (numerous crops).</p>

Other claims include reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into a number of crops to minimize the need for other, less environmentally beneficial, herbicides.</p>
