<p>Avoiding specimens from being attacked and harmed by pests is a significant obstacle of collection management. Some require long-term contracts that cost $400 or more even though for most pests, a single treatment done well need to be adequate. Once the committee comprehends the types of pests that might get in the building and possibly damage collection materials, the next action is to establish an IPPM program to deal with the recognized requirements.</p>
