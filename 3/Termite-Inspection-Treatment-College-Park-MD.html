<p>Socio-psychological factors consisting of ethical and rational considerations were found to the motorists in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka revealed that nearly 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness occurrence and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) likewise revealed that an absence of certified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an impediment for IPM implementation in industrialized nations.</p>
<p>In reference to the principle of integrating using biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later on expanded to welcome coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>They are chosen and used in a method that prevents interfering with other IPM practices if pesticides are essential. Practically every type of pest presents a threat to the residential or commercial properties they inhabit, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards.

<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, linger in the environment for days, weeks or perhaps longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential element of an incorporated pest management program. But by focusing on non-chemical alternatives first, you can guarantee that your pest management program is successfully eliminating pests at the least threat to your food security program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
