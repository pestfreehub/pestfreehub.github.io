<p>Socio-psychological aspects consisting of moral and logical factors to consider were discovered to the drivers in IPM implementation in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A survey of veggie growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications prior to pest or illness event and just 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that an absence of qualified IPM specialists and extension educators was an obstacle for IPM implementation in developed countries.</p>
<p>Natural opponents can be reliable, and pesticides (chemical compounds for managing pests) are only used when alternative choices do not produce the necessary outcome.
