The idea of IPM is to keep track of and control pests just when they begin appearing and getting rid of the over application of pesticides in the living environmentWe are well versed with IPM techniques, Scope of works, application methods and industry particular record keeping procedures.</p>
<p>Kaolin particle films utilized in natural farming might control some pests, but can adversely affect natural opponents and trigger other pests to multiply (Markó et al. 2008 ). Organic farming practices might motivate natural enemy populations, but a higher number of natural opponents does not always result in pest suppression (Dara 2014 ). Mechanical pest control practices such as vacuuming or tilling utilize nonrenewable fuel sources and indirectly have an unfavorable impact on the environment.</p>
