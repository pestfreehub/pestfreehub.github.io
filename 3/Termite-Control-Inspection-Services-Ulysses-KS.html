<p>Part of this success came from field schools which allowed local farmers to harness their indigenous understanding of natural pest control to IPM (Morse & Buhler 1997). IPM is the choice and usage of pest control actions that will guarantee favourable financial condition, eco-friendly and social consequences 13 and applies to the majority of agricultural, public health and amenity pest management circumstances.</p>
<p>They primarily use natural strategies and pesticides that are evaluated and licensed and are safe for usage and do not have any hazardous impacts on the environment.

Mix pesticides according to identify guidelines. Waage (39) suggests that biopesticides could form the methadone of IPM," helping agroecosystems to recuperate from the practice of calendar spraying while we are redesigning and nurturing them to a more self-renewing capacity.</p>
<p>Concurrently, it is likewise based on semiochemicals particularly allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are fended off or discouraged away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are simultaneously brought in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ).
