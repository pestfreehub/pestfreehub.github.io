<p>Pest management needs a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used only after regular monitoring shows that a pest population had reached an economic threshold level. Numerous individual product growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM suggests for their crop and region, and IPM-labeled foods are offered in limited areas.</p>
<p>There are 2 various kinds of pest control services. Cultural controls are practices that reduce pest facility, recreation, dispersal, and survival. Growers in Bangladesh, Haiti, Moldova, and Myanmar, during training programs arranged by the U.S. Agency for International Development, shared that natural farming is more tough than conventional farming especially for pest management, but they produce organically because of high returns (individual interaction).</p>
<p>The human response depends on the significance of the damage done, and will vary from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to efforts to totally get rid of the pest.
