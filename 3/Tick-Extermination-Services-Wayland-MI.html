<p>Thank you for choosing RID Pest Control to protect your home from termites. In Asia, various stages of IPM have been effectively embraced in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>In reference to the principle of integrating using biological and other controls in complementary methods, the term was later broadened to accept coordinated use of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have actually been selected either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to have higher levels of resistance.</p>

<p>Although numerous sources define IPM in different methods, previous designs mainly concentrated on the environmental, and to some level on the evolutionary, elements of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ).
