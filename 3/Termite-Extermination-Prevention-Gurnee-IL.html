The reliance on pesticides as a sole method of control has resulted in the development of insect resistance and unfavorable results on human health, natural opponents, and the environment.</p>
<p>As talked about previously, understanding about the eco-friendly interrelationships in between insects and their environment is important to reliable pest management.
