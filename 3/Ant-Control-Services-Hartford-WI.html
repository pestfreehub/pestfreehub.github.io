However, the high potential for reproduction of insect pests remains, and a population surge of lots of species can be anticipated from a low-density level whenever ideal ecological conditions take place or control slackens. Under this scheme, bug control was "supervised" by certified entomologists, and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from regular tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations.</p>
<p>The number of plants inspected will depend upon elements such as the value of the crop, potential problems and size and type of greenhouses. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) combines various types of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to conventional synthetic pesticides-- in a sensible, long-lasting plan. Biopesticides are typically compatible with natural enemies, however there are exceptions.</p>

Periodical releases of commercially readily available natural enemies or conserving natural enemy populations by providing havens or preventing practices that damage them are some of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>
