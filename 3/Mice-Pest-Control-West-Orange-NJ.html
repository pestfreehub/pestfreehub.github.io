<p>The benefits of Integrated Pest Management are tremendous directly to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control includes the use of living organisms to control a pest population. Do not blend pesticides. There are four significant elements in the brand-new IPM design that address numerous pest management choices, the knowledge, and resources the grower needs to deal with the pest concern, preparation and company of information to take suitable management actions, and keeping good communication to get and distribute understanding about pests and their management.</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, linger in the environment for days, weeks and even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential component of an integrated pest management program. But by concentrating on non-chemical options initially, you can make sure that your pest management program is effectively getting rid of pests at the least threat to your food security program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>
