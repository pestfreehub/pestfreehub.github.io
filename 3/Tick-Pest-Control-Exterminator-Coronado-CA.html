<p>For some tasks, pest control workers use a mix of pest management techniques, a practice known as integrated pest management. The foundation of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of routine inspections. Crop losses due to arthropods, illness, and weeds, though contested by some as a legitimate measure, have increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the intensification of pest control.</p>
<p>The approach to be picked for IPM depends upon lots of elements, the crucial of which are nature of target pest, the environment, and economic element of the management. Insect pests trigger significant losses to food and fiber crops worldwide.
