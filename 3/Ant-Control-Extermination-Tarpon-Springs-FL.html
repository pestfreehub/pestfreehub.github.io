A pest control company does not simply go straight to removing pests.</p>
<p>If pesticides are required, they are chosen and used in a way that avoids interfering with other IPM practices. Almost every kind of pest postures a danger to the properties they occupy, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards.
