This chapter discusses various methods to maintain pest insects at tolerable levels or simply put incorporated pest management (IPM).

<p>This technique of pest control has actually fallen out of favour in recent years because fire eliminates helpful insects along with the pests and can have a negative impact on the soil. To reduce prospective harm to helpful insects, limit your spraying to little locations where you can see pests prowling, and leave a number of unsprayed "sanctuaries" for any excellent bugs you can't see.</p>
