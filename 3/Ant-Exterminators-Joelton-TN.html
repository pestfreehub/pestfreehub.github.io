<p>More details is required about food-chain concentration and useful ways of removing harmful impacts of pesticide residues that may remain in the environment after the pesticides have actually served their purpose. Don't base pest management programs on overall removal of a pest. Pests attack plants from all over: rodents and nematode ruin roots in the earth, snails, and larvae damage berries and leaves originating from the ground, and birds eat up fruit and seeds attacking from the air.</p>
<p>Stored item pests are probably to be in a food ingredient on shipment to a processing factory or a processed food product when stored for a long time. Using pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a regular basis, despite need, is not IPM.
