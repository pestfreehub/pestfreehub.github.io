The pest management industry is big, with over 15,000 companies serving the public and around 150,000 pest control service workers. Cockroaches, mosquitoes, ants, rodents, termites, rats, wasps, bedbugs, lizards, mice, spiders, yellow jackets, bees and flies are commonly found pests in our society.</p>
<p>A comprehensive knowledge of basic IPM principles and different management choices for all possible pest problems is necessary as some are preventive and others are curative.

Sustainable growing needs crops to be resistant to infestations and diseases, and the environment in which they are grown requirements to have a capacity to repair itself.</p>
