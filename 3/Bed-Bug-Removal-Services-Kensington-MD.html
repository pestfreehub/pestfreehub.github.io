<p><img src="https://pestimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pest-treatment.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>The red imported fire ant is a popular and troublesome  pest throughout the southeastern United States. Pest management requires a holistic method to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are used only after regular monitoring indicates that a pest population had actually reached an economic limit level. Lots of private product growers, for such crop as strawberries and potatoes, are working to specify what IPM indicates for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are available in limited areas.</p>
<p>For instance, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making process that combines biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to identify, manage, and lower danger from pests and pest management tools and techniques in a way that minimizes overall economic, health, and ecological threats.</p>
